TASK 1 - EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

INTRODUCTION

In today’s world, email has become a crucial way for people to communicate. Spam is those annoying emails we didn’t ask for, like ads or scams, that fill up our email inboxes and that is sent to a massive number of users at one time. In this Project,use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let’s get started!

FEATURES

Utilizes Python for building the email spam detector. Applies machine learning algorithms for training and classification. Implements label encoding to transform categorical data. Uses Logistic Regression for the classification task. Allows for custom prediction inputs.

INSTALLATION

To run the email spam detector, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

•Python 3.x •numpy •pandas •scikit-learn
